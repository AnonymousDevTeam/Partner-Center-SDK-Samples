# Partner-Center-SDK-Samples
Contains sample code on how to use the partner center .NET SDK

Please note that Partner Center .NET SDK samples will be moving to a new repository in Github, the new location is https://github.com/Microsoft/Partner-Center-DotNet-Samples 
(current repository location is https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples ). 
We will try to keep the two repositories in sync until we deprecate the current repository on December 1st 2018.
